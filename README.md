Extension that plays `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.m4v`, **`.mkv`**, `.avi`, **`.webm`** (plus
`.m2ts`, `.mts`, `.flv`, `.f4v`) videos (video **and** audio) in a Visual Studio
Code editor tab. You can keep the video open in one pane and keep writing code in
another by splitting the editor — no external windows.

## What's new

- **0.8.9** — **Rotate 90°** (`T`) for sideways phone videos, and **A-B loop** (`[` `]`) to repeat a segment.
- **0.8.8** — Timeline **time tooltip**: hover the progress bar to preview the exact timestamp before you click.
- **0.8.7** — Refreshed **glass control bar**, a **keyboard-shortcuts overlay** (`?`), and **frame-by-frame** stepping (`,` / `.`).
- **0.8.5** — **Audio boost** to 200%, **loop**, and **subtitle timing** nudge (`Z` / `X`).
- **0.8.3** — **WebM (VP9/VP8)** playback via on-the-fly transcoding.

## Why this one

Video extensions for VS Code tend to fall into two camps. **Classic players** show
MP4 but stay **silent** (Chromium in VS Code can't decode AAC), can't open MKV, and
choke on HEVC — or they **make you install `ffmpeg` yourself**. **Heavyweight
players** do add HEVC/AV1, but ship a large per-webview decoder and **loosen the
security policy** to get there.

This one is built to give you the best of both: it **bundles `ffmpeg`** (compiled
to WebAssembly), so MP4, **MKV and even HEVC/H.265** play **with audio out of the
box** — while staying a **single, lightweight, secure, fully offline** extension
with a strict CSP and no local server. You get the format coverage of the heavy
players without giving up the things that made the simple ones safe.

- 🔊 **Real audio, out of the box** — even **AAC** (plus AC-3, Opus, Vorbis), which the VS Code engine can't decode on its own, so most in-editor players show your MP4/MKV **silently**. Here it just plays, with sound — on MP4, MKV, MOV, M4V, AVI, M2TS/MTS, FLV, F4V & WebM
- 🎬 **HEVC / H.265 and WebM (VP9/VP8) too** — converted to H.264 on the fly, since VS Code can't decode them natively
- ⚡ **Zero setup** — `ffmpeg` is bundled; nothing to install
- 🔒 **Secure & offline** — no network, no local server, read-only editor, strict CSP
- 🎛️ **Modern control bar** — a floating glass panel with a seekable timeline (**hover to preview the timestamp**), speed (0.25×–2×), **audio boost to 200%**, **loop** & **A-B loop**, **rotate 90°**, **frame-by-frame** (`,`/`.`), Picture-in-Picture, fullscreen, and a **shortcuts overlay** (`?`)
- 📝 **Subtitles, zero config** — drop a `.srt`/`.vtt` with the same name next to the video and it just appears (SRT is converted on the fly); toggle with `C`
- 📸 **Grab a frame, paste anywhere** — `S` captures the current frame so you can **Copy** it straight into a chat with your AI assistant, an issue or a doc — or **Save** it as a PNG. No screenshot tool, no leaving VS Code
- 💾 **Remembers** your volume, speed and **resume position** per file
- 🪶 **Lightweight & focused** — does one thing, well
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform** — one universal package for Windows, Linux and macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)

*"Converted on the fly" = a short one-time conversion (with a "Converting…" badge),
not real-time HEVC decode — the trade for staying lightweight and keeping a strict
security policy.*

## How it works

VS Code is built on Electron (Chromium), so an HTML5 `<video>` tag in a Webview
plays the **H.264** video of MP4/MOV/M4V files. The VS Code engine, however, does
not decode **AAC** (and other) audio: that's why the extension extracts the audio
track and transcodes it locally — with a **bundled `ffmpeg` compiled to
WebAssembly** — into MP3, then plays it **in sync** with the video. Everything
happens offline, on your PC, from a **single universal package** (no per-platform
binaries). The extension registers a *Custom Editor* for `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.m4v`,
`.mkv`, `.avi`, `.m2ts`, `.mts`, `.flv`, `.f4v` and `.webm`.

For containers VS Code can't open directly — **`.mkv`**, `.avi`, `.m2ts`, `.mts`,
`.flv`, `.f4v`, `.webm` — the extension **remuxes** the H.264 video into a temporary
MP4 (a fast repackage, no re-encoding) so the Webview can play it, then extracts the
audio the same way. When the video is **HEVC or VP9/VP8** (which the Webview can't
decode), it is converted to H.264 on the fly instead of just repackaged.

## Installation

### From a `.vsix` file
1. Download the `.vsix` file (from the *Releases* page, or build it yourself, see below).
2. In VS Code: **Extensions** (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) → `...` menu → *Install from VSIX...*
3. Or from the terminal: `code --install-extension mp4-player.vsix`

### Usage
- Open a `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.m4v`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.m2ts`, `.mts`, `.flv`, `.f4v` or `.webm` file from the Explorer: the player starts.
- To place code and video side by side, use the editor split (`Ctrl+\` or drag the tab).
- A **custom control bar** appears at the bottom of the player on mouse move
  (play/pause, seekable timeline, time, volume **with boost to 200%**, playback
  speed, loop, Picture-in-Picture, fullscreen) and fades out during playback.
  Keyboard shortcuts work too (see below).
- **Subtitles, zero config**: drop a `.srt` (or `.vtt`) file with the **same name**
  next to the video and it loads automatically — no menus, no import step. SRT is
  converted to WebVTT on the fly and the cues are injected directly into the player
  (so VS Code's strict security policy never blocks them). Toggle with the `CC`
  button or `C`; if a downloaded subtitle is out of sync, nudge it with `Z` / `X`.
- **Capture a frame**: press `S` (or the camera button) to grab the current frame,
  then **Copy** it to the clipboard or **Save** it as a PNG. *Copy* is the handy
  one: paste the still straight into a chat with your AI assistant, a bug report or
  some notes — without a separate screenshot tool and without leaving VS Code.
- **Right-click menu on the file**: VS Code's generic Cut/Copy/Paste entries are
  hidden inside the player — they can't do anything with a video. Instead you get
  actions on the file itself: **Copy Video File** (the file goes on the system
  clipboard, ready to paste into a chat, an e-mail or a file manager), **Copy File
  Path** and **Show in Folder** (Finder / File Explorer).

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Space` / `K` | Play / Pause |
| `←` / `→` | Back / Forward 5s |
| `,` / `.` | Previous / next frame (when paused) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Volume up / down (up to 200%) |
| `<` / `>` | Slower / Faster (0.25×–2×) |
| `M` | Mute |
| `R` | Loop on/off |
| `[` / `]` | Set A-B loop point A / B |
| `\` | Clear A-B loop |
| `T` | Rotate 90° |
| `P` | Picture-in-Picture |
| `S` | Capture frame (copy or save as PNG) |
| `C` | Subtitles on/off |
| `Z` / `X` | Nudge subtitles earlier / later (±0.5s) |
| `F` | Fullscreen |
| `?` | Show this shortcut list in the player |

> Tip: press `?` inside the player to see all shortcuts at any time.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run compile      # or: npm run watch
```

Press **F5** in VS Code to open the *Extension Development Host* test window.

### Packaging (.vsix)

```bash
npm run package
```

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). In short: restrictive Content-Security-Policy,
cryptographic nonce, file access limited to the video's folder, read-only editor,
no network connections.

## Supported codecs

- **Video**: **H.264** (the most common) plays in any supported container
  (MP4/MOV/M4V directly; MKV/AVI/M2TS/MTS/FLV/F4V/WebM remuxed to MP4 first).
  **H.265/HEVC** (8- or 10-bit) and **WebM's VP9/VP8** are **converted to H.264
  on the fly** — VS Code can't decode them itself, so the bundled ffmpeg does it
  (a one-time wait, shown as "Converting video…"); very large/long files are
  skipped to keep that wait short. Codecs that can't be decoded at all (e.g.
  **AV1**) show a clear error **naming the codec found**, so you know exactly why.
- **Audio**: handled via local transcoding with a bundled WebAssembly `ffmpeg`,
  so it works even with **AAC** (which VS Code does not decode on its own) — and
  AC-3, ALAC and other codecs too. The audio is converted to a temporary MP3 the
  VS Code engine plays reliably, then cached for instant reopens. The cache
  **cleans itself up** (files older than 7 days, and a 1 GB cap).

## Platforms

**One universal package** for all platforms — Windows, Linux and macOS (Intel &
Apple Silicon). Audio works everywhere thanks to a bundled `ffmpeg` compiled to
WebAssembly: no native binaries, nothing to install.
